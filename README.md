# lighten-up-the-sky
My first 2D platform game made with Phaser, which contains 3 levels.

In order to lighten up the sky and get to the end, the player has to jump the sprite from ledge to ledge to collect all the stars. The movement is controlled by direction buttons. The enemies walking around will hurt the sprite when they bump into each other, so try to avoid them until the HP goes empty.
